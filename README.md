<b>Figure 1:</b> We built a series of teleoperated medical crash cart robots. Prototype 1 delivers supplies using a hoverboard circuit. Prototype 2 also delivers supplies, recommends supplies using drawer opening capabilities, and was deployed at a medical training event which revealed insights which led to the design of Prototype 3 that communicates recommendations and reminders using drawer lights, speech, and alerts.

## Introduction

Designing robots to support high-stakes teamwork in emergency settings presents unique challenges, including seamless integration into fast-paced environments, facilitating effective communication among team members, and adapting to rapidly changing situations. While tele-operated robots have been successfully used in high-stakes domains such as firefighting and space exploration, autonomous robots that aid high-stakes teamwork remain underexplored. To address this gap, we conducted a rapid prototyping process to develop a series of seemingly autonomous robot designed to assist clinical teams in the Emergency Room. We transformed a standard crash cart‚Äîwhich stores medical equipment and emergency supplies into a medical robotic crash cart (MCCR). The MCCR was valuated through field deployments to assess its impact on team workload and usability, identified taxonomies of failure, and refined the MCCR in collaboration with healthcare professionals. Our work advances the understanding of robot design for high-stakes, time-sensitive settings, providing insights into useful MCCR capabilities and considerations for effective human-robot collaboration. By publicly disseminating our MCCR tutorial, we hope to encourage HRI researchers to explore the design of robots for high-stakes teamwork.

## Medical Crash Cart Robot Tutorial Steps

### Step 1: Set up micro SD card (12 minutes)
### Step 2: Attach the LED strip to the cart (10 minutes)
### Step 3: Connect Electronics (10 minutes)
### Step 4: Boot the Raspberry Pi (12 minutes)
### Step 5: Download necessary files (6 minutes)
### Step 6: Download Robot Operating System 2 (55 min)
### Step 7: Install necessary tools (6 min)
### Step 8: Test and edit light code for compatibility (25 minutes)

8.1 Open a new terminal window and run the following to run the light node
```
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
colcon build --symlink-install
cd robot_communication_ws
source install/setup.bash
ros2 run light_pkg light_node
```

8.2 Try pressing a couple of the buttons and watch the lights on the carts flash. You may have noticed that the buttons don‚Äôt light the correct LEDs. If this is the case, you must edit the code to be compatible with your cart.

8.3 Go to your files, follow this file path, and open the py file: Home ‚Üí robot_communication_ws ‚Üí source ‚Üí light_pkg ‚Üí light_pkg ‚Üí light_node.py

8.4 Open a new terminal window and rerun the module by entering the following (quick tip, if you press the up arrow you can the following commands in your history and can enter them like that to make it easier):
```
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
colcon build --symlink-install
cd robot_communication_ws
source install/setup.bash
ros2 run light_pkg light_node
```

8.5 Once you‚Äôve run the program, click the first button and watch to see which lights flash. If only one pair lights up, the program is trying to light LEDs we‚Äôve cut off.

8.6 Go to the portion of the light_node code shown below.

<b>Figure 7:</b> Code snippet for modifying RGB values, LED colors, and corresponding LED lights. 

8.7 Each four-line section of code corresponds to one button on the pop-up, one drawer that needs to be lit. Editing the number in the square brackets for the first section will change which LED is lit when the first button is pressed. Increasing the number will make the lit LED further from the end with the wires, decreasing it will make the LED closer to that end.

8.8 Edit the number, press the save button at the top of the code‚Äôs window, press Control C in the terminal window to stop the program, open a new window, then rerun the node:
```
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
cd robot_communication_ws
source install/setup.bash
ros2 run light_pkg light_node
```

8.9 Look to see which LEDs light up now. Is it still too far one way? Or maybe now too far the other way? Repeat step h until each button properly lights a different drawer from both sides with the final two buttons flashing all the lights. This should take around 15 minutes.

### Step 9: Connect the Bluetooth speaker (1 minute)

9.1 Make sure your speaker is turned on and in range.

9.2 Go to the top right corner of the screen. Click ‚ÄúBluetooth On‚Äù, then ‚ÄúBluetooth Settings‚Äù. Once your speaker pops up, click its name and switch on the connection.

### Step 10: Test the alert module (1 minute)

10.1  Open a terminal and run the following commands to test the alert module:
```
cd robot_communication_ws
source install/setup.bash
ros2 run alert_pkg alert_node
```

10.2 Click the buttons, and you should hear beeping!

### Step 11: Test the dialogue module (1 minute)

11.1 Open a terminal and run the following commands to test the dialogue module:
```
cd robot_communication_ws
source install/setup.bash
ros2 run dialogue_pkg dialogue_node
```

11.2 Click the buttons, and you should hear the robot‚Äôs dialogue.

## Congratulations! You are now the proud owner of a robotic crash cart.
