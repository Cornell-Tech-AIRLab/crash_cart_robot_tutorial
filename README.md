<b>Figure 1:</b> We built a series of teleoperated medical crash cart robots. Prototype 1 delivers supplies using a hoverboard circuit. Prototype 2 also delivers supplies, recommends supplies using drawer opening capabilities, and was deployed at a medical training event which revealed insights which led to the design of Prototype 3 that communicates recommendations and reminders using drawer lights, speech, and alerts.
