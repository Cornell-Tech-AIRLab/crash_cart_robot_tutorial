<b>Figure 1:</b> We built a series of teleoperated medical crash cart robots. Prototype 1 delivers supplies using a hoverboard circuit. Prototype 2 also delivers supplies, recommends supplies using drawer opening capabilities, and was deployed at a medical training event which revealed insights which led to the design of Prototype 3 that communicates recommendations and reminders using drawer lights, speech, and alerts.

## Introduction

Designing robots to support high-stakes teamwork in emergency settings presents unique challenges, including seamless integration into fast-paced environments, facilitating effective communication among team members, and adapting to rapidly changing situations. While tele-operated robots have been successfully used in high-stakes domains such as firefighting and space exploration, autonomous robots that aid high-stakes teamwork remain underexplored. To address this gap, we conducted a rapid prototyping process to develop a series of seemingly autonomous robot designed to assist clinical teams in the Emergency Room. We transformed a standard crash cart‚Äîwhich stores medical equipment and emergency supplies into a medical robotic crash cart (MCCR). The MCCR was valuated through field deployments to assess its impact on team workload and usability, identified taxonomies of failure, and refined the MCCR in collaboration with healthcare professionals. Our work advances the understanding of robot design for high-stakes, time-sensitive settings, providing insights into useful MCCR capabilities and considerations for effective human-robot collaboration. By publicly disseminating our MCCR tutorial, we hope to encourage HRI researchers to explore the design of robots for high-stakes teamwork.
